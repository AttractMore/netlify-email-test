## Netlify Email test

This is just a test for me to show I can use the new Netlify email integration with SendGrid. Much of the code comes from [Netlify](https://docs.netlify.com/integrations/email-integration/#enable-netlify-email-integration-for-your-site).

I've chained 2 fetch POST requests to the email API the 2nd being contingent on the first one being successful.

One of the emails uses MJML. I've modified a template available on the [MJML website](https://mjml.io/templates).
